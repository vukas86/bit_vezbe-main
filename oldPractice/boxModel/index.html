        cerebro. Nescio brains an Undead zombies. Sicut malus putrid voodoo horror. Nigh tofth eliv ingdead. Do you see
        any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you
        see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that
        shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a
        toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
        Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.

        They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the
        last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and
        they will sell me, and they will lose.

        Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
        napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
        sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
        people were in their way.

        No. She's not there now.

        And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and
        silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .... Anyway. Thought you
        were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!

        .... And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
        yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
        say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
        there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
        you're gonna need it ... badly... So ....

        They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life
        for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me
        a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
        it just ain't there. WINNING!

        You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly
        children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and
        say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just
        sit back and enjoy the show .... You know?

        And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner
        from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims.

        And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
        union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
        the bible grippers.

        And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
        News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.

        Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and
        trolls.

        Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out
        there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
        embarrass them in the process.</p>

        called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they
        decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't,
        become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

        Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.
